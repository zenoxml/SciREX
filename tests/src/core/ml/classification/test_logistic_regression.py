    Module: test_logistic_regression.py

    This module contains unit tests for the Logistic Regression implementation 
    within the SciREX framework. It tests various configurations of the 
    LogisticRegression class.

    Classes:
        TestLogisticRegression: Defines unit tests for different functionalities 
        and configurations of the LogisticRegression class.

    Dependencies:
        - unittest
        - numpy
        - sklearn.datasets
        - scirex.core.ml.supervised.classification.logistic_regression
