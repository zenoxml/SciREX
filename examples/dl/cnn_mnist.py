    Example Script: cnn-mnist.py

    This script demonstrates how to use the neural network implementation from the SciREX library to perform classification on the MNIST dataset.

    This example includes:
        - Loading the MNIST dataset using tensorflow.keras.datasets
        - Splitting the data into train and test sets
        - Training Convolutional Neural Networks
        - Evaluating and visualizing the results
