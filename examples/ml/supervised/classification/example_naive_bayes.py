    Module: example_naive_bayes.py

    This module demonstrates the usage of the NaiveBayes class
    for Gaussian class-conditional densities using the Iris dataset.

    Dependencies:
        - scikit-learn
        - pandas
        - numpy
        - scirex.core.ml.unsupervised.clustering.kmeans.NaiveBayes

    Example Usage:
        Run this script to load the Iris dataset, fit the NaiveBayes
        classifier, and evaluate its performance metrics.

    Authors:
