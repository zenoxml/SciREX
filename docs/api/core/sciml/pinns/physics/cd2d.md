# Loss Function Implementation for 2D Convection-Diffusion Problem

## Overview
This module implements the loss function for solving 2D convection-diffusion equations using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). It focuses on computing residuals of the Partial Differential Equation (PDE) with known coefficients.

## Key Functions
- **`pde_loss_cd2d`**: Computes the PDE loss for 2D convection-diffusion equations.

## Function: `pde_loss_cd2d`

### Description
Calculates residuals for the 2D convection-diffusion problem using the PINNs methodology.  
The loss function includes:
- **Diffusion term**: `-ε∇²(u)`
- **Convection term**: `b·∇u`
- **Reaction term**: `cu`  
where `ε`, `b`, and `c` are known coefficients.

### Arguments

  **Shape**: `(N_points, 1)`
- **`pred_grad_x_nn`** (`tf.Tensor`): x-derivative of the neural network solution at quadrature points.  
  **Shape**: `(N_points, 1)`
- **`pred_grad_y_nn`** (`tf.Tensor`): y-derivative of the neural network solution at quadrature points.  
  **Shape**: `(N_points, 1)`
- **`pred_grad_xx_nn`** (`tf.Tensor`): Second-order x-derivative of the neural network solution at quadrature points.  
  **Shape**: `(N_points, 1)`
- **`pred_grad_yy_nn`** (`tf.Tensor`): Second-order y-derivative of the neural network solution at quadrature points.  
  **Shape**: `(N_points, 1)`
- **`forcing_function`** (`callable`): Right-hand side forcing term.
- **`bilinear_params`** (`dict`): A dictionary containing:
  - **`eps`**: Diffusion coefficient.
  - **`b_x`**: x-direction convection coefficient.
  - **`b_y`**: y-direction convection coefficient.
  - **`c`**: Reaction coefficient.

### Returns
- **`tf.Tensor`**: Cell-wise residuals averaged over test functions.  
  **Shape**: `(1,)`

### Notes
- The methodology combines the effects of diffusion, convection, and reaction in a unified residual formulation.
