##  Scientific Machine Learning 

At the heart of SciREX lies our advanced Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) capabilities. We're pioneering the fusion of physical knowledge with machine learning to create more accurate, efficient, and interpretable models.

### Featured SciML Components
#### FastVPINNs

 - **Finite Elements (FE)**

 - **Physics Modules**

 - **Model**

 - **Geometry**

## Traditional Machine Learning Suite

While we excel in SciML, we maintain comprehensive support for traditional machine learning approaches:

### Clustering & Classification
- Hierarchical clustering
- Spectral methods
- Deep learning
- Classification
- Ensemble methods


##  Key Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized implementations for both CPU and GPU
- **Scalability**: From  experiments to HPC 

##  Getting Started

```bash
pip install scirex
```

```python
import scirex as sx

# Initializel
model = sx.models
```
