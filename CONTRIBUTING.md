## Styleguides

### Code Style and Documentation

#### Google Style Guide Adaptation for Scientific Computing

We follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) with specific adaptations for scientific computing:

##### Function and Variable Names
```python
# Good
def solve_navier_stokes(reynolds_number, initial_conditions):
    velocity_field = initialize_flow_field()
    pressure_gradient = compute_pressure_gradient()
    
# Bad
def solveNS(re, ic):
    v = init_flow()
    dp = comp_press()
```

##### Docstring Format
```python
def compute_finite_difference(
    function_values: np.ndarray, 
    dx: float, 
    order: int = 2
) -> np.ndarray:
    """Computes finite difference approximation of derivatives.

    Implements centered finite difference scheme of specified order for
    approximating derivatives of discrete data.

    Args:
        function_values: Array of function values at discrete points.
            Shape: (n_points,) or (n_points, n_dimensions)
        dx: Grid spacing (assumed uniform)
        order: Order of accuracy for finite difference scheme.
            Must be 2 or 4. Defaults to 2.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Approximated derivatives at each point.
            Same shape as input function_values.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If order is not 2 or 4
        ValueError: If function_values has less than order + 1 points

    Notes:
        Uses the following stencils:
        2nd order: f'(x) ≈ (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2h)
        4th order: f'(x) ≈ (-f(x+2h) + 8f(x+h) - 8f(x-h) + f(x-2h))/(12h)

            and Partial Differential Equations.
    """
```

##### Module-Level Docstrings
```python
"""Solvers for partial differential equations using finite element methods.

This module implements various finite element solvers for elliptic, parabolic,
and hyperbolic PDEs. The implementation follows the formulation in Hughes (2000)
with extensions for stabilized methods.

Key classes:
    - FEMSolver: Base solver class
    - EllipticSolver: For elliptic PDEs
    - ParabolicSolver: For parabolic PDEs

Key functions:
    - assemble_stiffness_matrix: Assembles global stiffness matrix
    - solve_linear_system: Solves resulting linear system

Note that all solvers assume a well-posed problem with appropriate boundary
conditions.

```

##### Class Docstrings
```python
class AdaptiveMesh:
    """A mesh that adapts based on solution features.
    
    This class implements adaptive mesh refinement/coarsening based on
    error estimates. The refinement strategy follows the procedure outlined
    in Bank et al. (1983).
    
    Attributes:
        nodes: Array of node coordinates, shape (n_nodes, dimension)
        elements: Array of element connectivity, shape (n_elements, nodes_per_element)
        error_estimator: Callable that computes error estimates
        refinement_threshold: Float, threshold for mesh refinement

        >>> mesh.refine(error_threshold=1e-3)
        >>> solution = solve_pde(mesh)

    """
    if bounds[0] >= bounds[1]:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Lower bound {bounds[0]} must be less than upper bound {bounds[1]}"
