    Module: mlp.py

    This module implements Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network architecture.

    Key Classes:
        MLP: Multi-Layer Perceptron

    Key Features:
        - Built on top of base class getting all its functionalities
        - Efficient neural networks implementation using equinox modules

    Authors:
        - Lokesh Mohanty (lokeshm@iisc.ac.in)

    Version Info:
