# SciREX: Deep Learning

## Network

This class defines the architecture of the neural network to be trained

## Model

This class handles training the neural network and acts as an inteface to other neural
network based tasks

## FCNN (Fully Connected Neural Networks)
## MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
