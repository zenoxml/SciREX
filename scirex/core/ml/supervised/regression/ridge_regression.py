    Module: ridge_regression.py

    This module implements the RidgeRegressionModel class for ridge regression tasks,
    extending the base Regression class from the SciREX library.

    The implementation uses scikit-learn's Ridge regression model for:
        - Fitting the ridge regression algorithm
        - Generating predictions for input features
        - Evaluating performance using standard regression metrics

    Key Features:
        - Support for fitting a ridge regression model
        - Access to model parameters (coefficients, intercept)
        - Seamless integration with the SciREX regression pipeline

    Classes:
        RidgeRegressionModel: Implements a Ridge Regression model.

    Dependencies:
        - numpy
        - scikit-learn
        - scirex.core.ml.supervised.regression.base
